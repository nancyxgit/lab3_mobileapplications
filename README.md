I do this project with the help of my classmates. i have used some online AI.

This Android application features an automated image rotation system, where images change every 10 seconds. It also includes a Pause/Resume button, allowing users to control the rotation.

Features:
Automatic image rotation every 10 seconds.
Pause and Resume functionality to manage image transitions.
Smooth fade-in animation for seamless image changes.

Enhancements:
In this project, I developed the image rotation logic and integrated a Pause/Resume button for better control. Additionally, I implemented a fade-in effect to ensure smooth transitions between images. The primary modifications were made in the MainActivity.kt file to handle image switching and user interactions.
